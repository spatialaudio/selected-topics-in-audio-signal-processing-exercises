    "### Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you always use Python 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Python installed already, you should download and install a Python distribution which already includes all the libraries we'll need, e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (make sure to choose Python version 3.x).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/...), you can use the following commands to install the necessary packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sudo apt-get update\n",
    "    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib python3-cffi libsndfile1 libportaudio2\n",

    "### Get the Notebooks and Start Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [Git](http://git-scm.org/) to download the files (or download the [zip file](https://github.com/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises/archive/master.zip)), use the Python package management system [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) to install a few Python libraries that we will use and then start the Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises.git\n",
    "    cd communication-acoustics-exercises\n",
    "    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user\n",
    "    python3 -m notebook\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will open a new view in your web browser with a list of notebooks.\n",
    "Click on [intro.ipynb](intro.ipynb) (or any of the other available notebooks) and enjoy!\n",
    "If you are new to Git, have a look at this [introduction to Git](http://mg.rtfd.org/git.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also download individual notebook files (with the extension `.ipynb`) and open them in IPython.\n",
    "Note that some exercises make use of additional files (audio files etc.) which you'll then also have to download manually.\n",
