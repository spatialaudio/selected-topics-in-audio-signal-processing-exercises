    "Note that Python is not the only option for the kind of tasks that we'll tackle here.\n",
    "If you are interested in some alternatives, have a look at [Julia](http://julialang.org/), [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Octave](http://octave.org/) or [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/).\n",
    "All the mentioned applications are open-source software and there are of course even more alternatives (both free and proprietary).\n",

    "Most of the exercises in this course (including the one you're reading right now) are presented as [Jupyter (formerly known as IPython) notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "They can be [viewed online](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises/blob/master/index.ipynb), but it makes much more sense to download them and open and explore them locally with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).\n",

    "For installation instructions, see the section [Getting Started](index.ipynb#Getting-Started) on the main page.\n",
